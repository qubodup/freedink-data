** German translation (thanks Michael Skiba)

** Danish translation (thanks Joe Hansen)

** Partial Spanish translation (thanks Fernando Carmona Varo)

* v1.08.20090706

** Remove SAVE10.DAT

  Normally savegames are removed but this one was in uppercase.  I
  also fixed the build system so that it doesn't happen again.

* v1.08.20090705

** New sounds

  bird1.wav and high2.wav

** Translations

  Complete French and Dutch translations. Partial Macedonian
  translation.

** Fix game freeze

  When you talk to 'darkland dink' twice too fast, the game
  froze. This is fixed.

** More documentation

  How to generate MIDIs, packaging guidelines, dir.ff
  overview... cf. doc/

* v1.08.20081130

** Fix installation

  Preserve file permissions (requested by Fedora)

  Don't chown on /usr/local/share, but on /usr/local/share/dink/dink
  (reported by Stephen Hurd)

  Don't remove files (savegames, *~, etc.) in the destination dir when
  installing - only do that when preparing a release

  More work on distro packaging (Debian, Fedora, Gentoo)

* v1.08.20080920
