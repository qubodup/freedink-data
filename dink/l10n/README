This directory contains the translation template (dink.pot) and
several translations (XX.po).

This uses the gettext translation system - see:
http://www.freedink.org/doc/translate/

Translations are preferably submitted to the Translation Project:
http://www.translationproject.org/

nl.po is maintained "externally" (outside of the TP). Around 30
strings are still untranslated, plus dmod.diz.
