Distros

The autotools-based build system should install the files in the
right location.


dir.ff
------

It would be tempting to extract all the data and convert it to, say,
PNG.  However, there are some arguments against it:

- I did it, and the zip-compressed size for dir.ff is the same than
  for .png (!).  So it doesn't save download time.  This is probably
  because the pictures are 3D renders, and like photos, difficult to
  compress with a lossless format.  On disk, graphics/ passes from 36M
  to 18M, at the expense of 10-15x more files.

- When files are in a dir.ff, there is a special raw loading process
  that you would need to redo to maintain compatibility (in
  particular, to keep the same colors).  Introducing this process to
  non-dir.ff files implies modifying the dink.ini format, which is
  already difficult to parse while maintaining compatibility.  

- JPGs?  There will be a loss of quality, and they don't support 8bit
  mode, which will involve a number of tricks to redo
  dir.ff-compatible colors subsitutions and to avoid increased memory
  usage.

Conclusion: not worth the trouble.

However .d files were extracted for simplicity.
