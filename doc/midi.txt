To compose or edit MIDIs:

- Rosegarden: to edit music scores

- Fluidsynth: to generate sounds from the scores; we could use TiMidity++ too:

- Jack: sound daemon requested by Rosegarden

- fluid-soundfont-gs fluid-soundfont-gm: sound fonts, used by
  Fluidsynth to reproduce different instruments (150MB)


# To install under Debian GNU/Linux:

aptitude install rosegarden jackd fluidsynth \
  fluid-soundfont-gs fluid-soundfont-gm

# You can also use graphical interfaces to start Fluidsynth and Jackd:

aptitude install qsynth qjackctl


# To run:

jackd -d alsa &  # optional? Rosegarden complains but still plays
fluidsynth -m alsa_seq /usr/share/sounds/sf2/FluidR3_GM.sf2
rosegarden myscore.rg


# To save the data as a .wav, run fluidsynth differently:

fluidsynth -m alsa_seq /usr/share/sounds/sf2/FluidR3_GM.sf2 \
  -a file -o audio.file.name=myfile.raw

# Then you can import the .raw file in Audacity through:
# "File > Import > Raw Data"
# and using settings:
# "Signed 16 bit PCM / Little-endian / Stereo / 44100Hz"
# You may need to strip the silences, using:
# "Effects > Truncate Silence..."
